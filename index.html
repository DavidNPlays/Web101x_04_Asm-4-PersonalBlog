                    Last week flew by and before I knew it, it was time to plan the menu for Sunday dinner. Sundays have
                    been a perfect opportunity for me to experiment with new dessert recipes, especially those that
                    serve tons of people, since we have help polishing it all off and don't have it sitting around the
                    house, tempting us for days.

                    I have long associated the German Chocolate Cake with Father's Day, although I'm not entirely sure
                    why. I think I remember my mom making it for my dad once or twice growing up (although never on
                    Father's Day, ironically) and the correlation must have stuck somewhere along the way.
